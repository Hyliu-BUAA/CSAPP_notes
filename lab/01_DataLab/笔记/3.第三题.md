# 1. 解题思路
- First, we should figure out that the maximum of two's complement is 0x0111 for 4-bit level.
- Second, we should figure out that the bool value is only 0 when it's exactly 0. It is 1 othertimes.
- So, what we should do is that turning 0x0111 to bool 1, also we should be careful about the specific situations(e.g. 0x1111 for this problem)

# 2. 解题过程
1. First, we assume `x = 0x1111`.
2. `~x = 0x0000`
3. `x+1 = 0x0000`
4. `~x ^ x+1 = 0x0000`
5. `(x+1) = 0x0000`

1. First, we assume `x = 0x0111`.
2. `~x = 0x1000`
3. `x+1 = 0x1000`
4.  `~x ^ x+1 = 0x0000`
5. `(x+1) = 0x1000`

So, we observe the difference of above two fifth step: we should return 
`!((~x ^ x+1) | !(x+1))`
