1. Stack is `last-in, first-out (LIFO)`. To understand how C++ performs function calls, we should know it's using a stack data structure.
2. The function call stack supports the function `call/return` mechnism. It also supports the `creation, maintenance and destruction` of each called function's automic variables. 
3. Since the call stack is organized as a stack. The `caller` pushes the `return address` onto the stack, and the called function, when it finishes, pops the `return address` off the call stack and trasnfers control to that address. If a called function calls on to yet another function, it will push another return address onto call stack, and so on. With the information stacking up and unstacking as the program dictates.
4. So, we must keep track of the `return address` that each function needs to return control to its caller. Each time a function is called, an entry is pushed onto `call stack`. This entry called `stack frame, activation frame, activation record`, contains the return address that the  called function needs to return to the calling function. When the called function returns, the stack frame for the function call is popped, and control transfer to the return address in the popped stack frame.
